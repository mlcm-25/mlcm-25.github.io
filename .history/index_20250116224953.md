Last year we made an impact by running MLCM-24 in virtual format to allow world-wide connections. In exit survey, ~60% participants preffered in-person format, and we listened! 
We are thrilled to announce that **MLCM-25** conference will be held in-person in historic downtown of Santa Fe, US oldest capital.

<br> 
âš¡ MLCM-25 is an inclusive platform where early career scientists and senior experts will be able to forge unique connections similar to Gordon conference series. 
 What we offer: 
- no parallel sessions - all talks run sequentially for better immersion
- live-feed with codes and references - all relevant links are parsed during the talk and updated in real-time
- Santa Fe is a unique location with rich history, vibrant culture and unique cuisine

## Technical program

The integration of Machine Learning (ML) techniques into chemistry and materials science has brought about transformative advancements, boosting the pace and precision of predictions. Notable breakthroughs encompass property predictions for materials, the reverse and forward engineering of tailor-made molecules, the creation of transferable interatomic potentials, the formulation of differentiable physics models, intelligent exploration of chemical space, and the rationalization of experimental observations, to name just a few success stories.


## Topics  
â€¢	ML Methods for Exploring Equilibrium and Non-Equilibrium Processes   
â€¢	Best Practices in data Collection, Generation and Refinement
â€¢	Meta-Learning Models and Heterogeneous Data Sources    
â€¢	Development of Differentiable Physics Models    
â€¢	ML-Assisted Material Design and Search  
â€¢	ML for rational and autonomous experiments
